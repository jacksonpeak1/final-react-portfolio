              Hello, my name is Jackson Peak. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia,
              and I have lived in the state of Georgia my whole life. I reside
              in Acworth, Georgia. Additionally, I am currently enrolled in the
              coding boot camp at Georgia Tech. Furthermore, I attended John
              Marshall Law School prior to attending this bootcamp, and I
              graduated from Kennesaw State University with a bachelor's degree
              in political science. Some of my hobbies include: playing guitar,
              recording music, playing basketball, and fishing!
